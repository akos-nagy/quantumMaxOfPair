# quantumMaxOfPair
Qiskit code to compute the maximum of a pair of signed integers.
Based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqvNmzeRkA&t=288s by Anant Vigyan.

The method is modified so that it can also handle negative integers.

For details and explanation, please read the quantumMaxOfPair.pdf file.

The quantumMaxOfPair.py file contains the Python code, with an example, while quantumMaxOfPair.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook with the same code and example.
